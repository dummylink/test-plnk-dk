This configuration files are meant for the following scenario:

- MN
- CN Node ID 1 (target FPGA)
- CN Node ID 6
- CN Node ID 7

* The FPGA CN reads PReq from MN
  If the FPGA CN is configured as Poll-Response-Chaining node (by MN), it alternatively reads the same data via MN PRes instead of PReq.

* The FPGA CN reads direct cross-traffic from Node 6 and 7.
  This is achieved by dynamic mapping, so the Node IDs and the mapping for RPDO of CN 6 & 7 at the FPGA CN are written by the MN.

TODO:
Copy the file objdict.h and recompile the PCP project. Upload the new elf-file to the target.

  
Note: Automation Studio does not support XDC file import with cross traffic mapping. Thus an B&R MN can not be used.
