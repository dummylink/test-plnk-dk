This configuration files are meant for the following scenario:

- MN
- CN Node ID 1 (target FPGA)
- CN Node ID 6
- CN Node ID 7

* The FPGA CN reads PReq from MN
  If the FPGA CN is configured as Poll-Response-Chaining node (by MN), it alternatively reads the same data via MN PRes instead of PReq.

* The FPGA CN reads direct cross-traffic from Node 6 and 7.
  This is achieved by static mapping in objdict.h, so the Node IDs and the mapping for RPDO of CN 6 & 7 at the FPGA CN are fixed.

TODO:
Copy the file objdict.h and recompile the PCP project. Upload the new elf-file to the target.

  
Note: If you intend to use an B&R MN, ensure that the objects 0x1F81 and 0x1F8D are locally assigned in pcpMain.c 
	  with the function EplApiWriteLocalObject(); This is already done for the example projects.
	  Otherwise the FPGA CN will not recognize the presence of CN 6 & 7.

	  This issue does not occur with the openPOWERLINK MN when using openCONFIGURATOR, because the object 0x1F81 will be written by the MN.
