\mainpage
The CN API is an API designed to interface an application processor (AP) to a POWERLINK
communication Processor (PCP).

\section reqs Requirements
- C standard library functions: malloc(), free(), .....

\section targets Targets
The CN API is prepared to be compiled for miscellaneous processor targets. The following targets are supported
- nios2_newlib: Altera NIOS II processor using new newlib C library
- microblaze_newlib: Xilinx Microblaze processor using mb-gcc with standard C library

\section porting Porting
If the library should be ported to an other platform some parameters need to be adjusted by using the 
cnApiGlobal.h header in the folder common/inc. All platform specific parameters are given in this header.
If the benchmark module is also needed also the platform dependent parts in this file need to be ported.
All other platform dependet parts are located in the application outside the library in folder apps/ap_PDI/target.

\section objdict AP object dictionary
The AP has to create an object dictionary where all objects which are controlled by the AP are listed.

\section problems Problems
Currently there are no known problems inside the libCnApi.
