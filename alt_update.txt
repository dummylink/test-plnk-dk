Update Guide
==============================================================================

How to generally update to any version (applies always)
-------------------------------------------------------    

    - POWERLINK IP-core / Quartus Project
      Update the POWERLINK IP-core folder containments used for your Quartus project
      with the provided source files and completely rebuild the Quartus project
      starting with SOPC Builder.
      Before the rebuild, you need to delete all temporary  Quartus project files !

    - CnApi SW Library:
      Generate cnApiCfg.h by building the PCP design of the desired CNDK version 
      and update your Application Processor (AP) sources with the whole CnApi library source code
      which comes with the CNDK.

How to update from V0.2.0 or V0.2.1 to V0.4.6 
----------------------------------------------

I.   POWERLINK IP-core / Quartus Project
      
        1. In SOPC-Builder you need to specify a global search path for the POWERLINK IP-core once.
            Go to     
            "Tools -> Options -> IP Search Path -> Add"

            and browse to the POWERLINK IP-core folder e.g. in the CNDK

            <your path>/BR_POWERLINK-SLAVE_ALTERA_V0.4.6/02_Reference_Designs/fpga/altera/IP_core/POWERLINK

        2. Insert the POWERLINK IP-core from "Interface Protocols -> Ethernet -> POWERLINK". It will have the name "powerlink_1"
        3. Open the "powerlink_1" settings and copy the settings from the already existing IP-core "powerlink_0".
        4. Connect the bus and clock signals of "powerlink_1" the same way like "powerlink_0".
        5. Now you can delete the old "powerlink_0" IP-core in the SOPC builder.
        6. Delete the whole POWERLINK folder in your Quartus project, because the old POWERLINK IP-core is no longer used.
           Otherwise the SOPC Builder will always find 2 cores (which leads to version issues):
           The one that you have added to the IP-search path, and the one which is already present in the Quartus project.
        7. Rename "powerlink_1" to "powerlink_0".
        8. Compile the SOPC project.

II.  HW Interface (PCP PDI)
   
        - Adapt the timing according to the HW_Design_Guidelines delivered with this package.
          if you access the PCP over external FPGA interface (serial or parallel).      

III. CnApi SW Library
     
        - If you use the CnApi library in an AP
          to access and control the PCP (Powerlink Communication Processor)
          then you need to delete the calls to the functions
       
          * CnApi_activateApStateMachine()
          * CnApi_activateAsyncStateMachine()
        
          because those functions where shifted to the CnApi_init() function
          and are called now in the background.
          Any additional call to those functions will damage the AP to PCP communication!
      
        - It is mandatory to handle calls to CnApi_CbDefaultObdAccess() and optional to answer
          delayed to the object dictionary access with CnApi_DefObdAccFinished().
          See the documentation "API_Reference_Manual"  for details.
    
        - Events forwarded to the user in CnApi_AppCbEvent() can be handled optionally.
